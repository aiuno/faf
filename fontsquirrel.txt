Font squirrel works a little different than google fonts, for example, we cannot select the font-variants and/or weights before we download them.

They are also downloaded as zip files, so we need to unpack those.

They do have a pretty decent API though.

The suggested flow is this:
  - Download the zip
  - Unpack it
  - Copy the fonts we need
  - Delete the zip along with the unpacked one
