# faf

### A tool to easily download fonts on Linux üêß and MacOS üçè

Even though most if not all Linux distros have font installers.
None of the ones i have seen download them for you.

This tool makes is as easy as finding an open source font you want and typing:
`faf -S [font name]`

#### Currently supports Google Fonts

With planned support for [FontSquirrel](https://fontsquirrel.com), as well as any other relevant font providers with relatively decent API's.

#### All fonts downloaded with faf are FREE

Google fonts, as well as FontSquirrel both provide only fonts which are free for commercial use.

#### How do i use this?

Get build dependencies:

- Arch/Manjaro:`# pacman -S gcc cmake`
- Debian/Ubuntu:`# apt-get install cmake build-essential`
- MacOS: `$ brew install cmake`

First clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/aiuno/faf.git`

Create and go to the source code build directory:
`mkdir faf/build && cd faf/build`

Build the thing:
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make`

Finally, install it:
`sudo make install`

Now you can use faf.

For convenience, here is the output of `faf -h`:
